# Welcome to Jc Personal Trainer!

The project consists of developing a web app for Jc Personal Trainer, a team of personal trainers and professionals from CÃ³rdoba Capital


## Project details:
The project is developed with technologies such as JavaScript, Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind css and Shadcn. 

It is an informative Landing Page with the purpose of promoting the brand of this group of professional trainers, detailing their services and giving the possibility to communicate through a form (not working on purpose for now)



## Steps to view the site


In our default terminal, we clone the folder by typing "git clone" + link:

1- git clone https://github.com/Jcruzcorti/jcpersonaltrainer

2- Then, we place ourselves in the root folder of the project, with the command "cd raizcarpinteria" and install all the dependencies inside with the command "npm install".

3-Finally, in the terminal we carry out the command "npm run dev" or "yarn dev" and the web will open in the predetermined browser after a few seconds/minutes of waiting.
